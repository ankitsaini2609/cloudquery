In this blog post, I will walk you through the steps to create a new source plugin using CloudQuery JavaScript SDK. The purpose is to give you a basic overview of how to create tables and columns and how to sync the actual data. 

## What you need to know

Make sure you go over the core concepts of [CloudQuery](http://cloudquery.io/docs/core-concepts/plugins) and the [JavaScript SDK](http://cloudquery.io/docs/developers/creating-new-plugin/javascript-source).

## The Plan

At the high-level, this is what I would like to achieve:
- The plugin should support reading a set of CSV files from a directory.
- Each file will be synced as a single table in the destination.
- The column names will be read from the first row.
- The plugin should recognize basic types - I will start with numbers and everything else will be a string.

Here's what I imagine the configuration will look like:

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: "text-file"
  registry: "grpc"  # for local testing only, this will change once the plugin is published
  path: "localhost:7777" # same as above
  version: "v1.0.0"
  tables:
    ["*"]
  destinations:
    - "sqlite"
  spec:
    path: "test_data/" # specify folder or a single file
    csvDelimiter: ";"

---
kind: destination
spec:
  name: sqlite
  path: cloudquery/sqlite
  version: "v2.4.9"
  spec:
    connection_string: ./db.sql
```

## Getting Started
